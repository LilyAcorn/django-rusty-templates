# Contributing to django-rusty-templates

## Prerequisites

django-rusty-templates is written in Rust, so you'll need to install the
[Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

You can optionally install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) hooks to automatically run some validation checks when making a commit:
```shell
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
